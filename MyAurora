    "description": "The ‘Sleeping Beauty’ who falls asleep during the day is not only a princess, but also an un-aging and immortal witch. The witch, Aurora, has been punished by God and will fall asleep during the day, to wake up only when night falls. In order to break the curse, she and a young man collect light. As the collected light increases, the reasons for Aurora's punishment by God are gradually revealed.\n\nQuicksilver Discord Link: https://discord.gg/TcNBAjTyQj\n\nMangaka Weibo: https://weibo.com/u/5624117644",
