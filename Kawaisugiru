So she offered her friend Haru to come live with her rent-free if he'll cook, clean, and keep Reo away from bad relationships. It'll be great to have a good friend like Haru greet her with a cute smile and a warm meal when she comes home!\n\nSunflwr Scans Discord Link: https://discord.gg/3MjmEUqZgs\n\nMangaka Twitter: https://twitter.com/yorumohatarako",
