    "description": "Reo is a smart OL at work but an unkempt otaku at home. So she offered her friend Haru to come live with her rent-free if he'll cook, clean, and keep Reo away from bad relationships. It'll be great to have a good friend like Haru greet her with a cute smile and a warm meal when she comes home! \n\nQRose Mist  Discord Link: https://discord.gg/TcNBAjTyQj",
